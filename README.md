# GameSetMatch
GameSetMatch is an Android app that allows tennis players (or spectators) to record the points in a match and look at their stats. The user, firstly, is prompted to enter the name of the players/teams and then the game format. Next, the user can simply tap buttons on their screen based on what is happening in the match. Also, the user can choose to view stats at any point in the game and still go back and record points.
Android studio was used to develop this app.
