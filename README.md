# GameSetMatch
GameSetMatch is an Android app that allows tennis players (or spectators) to record the points in a match and look at their stats. The user, firstly, is prompted to enter the name of the players/teams and then the game format. Next, the user has to choose the first server and then can simply tap buttons on their screen based on what is happening in the match. Also, the user can choose to view stats at any point in the game and still go back and record points. Android studio was used to develop this app.

Currently, for match formats, the user can choose from the options of a set of 4 games (with or without Adv), a set of 6 games (with or without Adv), and a set of 8 games (with or without Adv). The reasons these options are offered is because this app was originally intended to help spectators of Division I, Division II or Division III tennis to record matches and stats. More options will be added later. Some screenshots can be viewed below.
